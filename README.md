OMG just walked out of Back in Action. mind’s totally tossed around like a salad ??? popcorn crumbs everywhere, sticking to my jeans and feeling like a weird massage or something. that theater was so loud, man, like literal thunder when the action scenes hit. but ok, wait, the plot... kinda, idk, it zigzagged like a drunk pigeon. had this feeling of being chased without a destination.

> one part with the car chase???? HOLY. adrenaline, pure and simple. felt like i was in the car, gripping the seat, which btw i think is gonna make my back regret sitting for that long. the villain—oh man, the guy had that waxy face, like he was carved outta candle wax or something, gave me the creeps in the best way possible. idk, maybe download the movie just to pause it at his close-ups.

there's this one line, totally outta place but suddenly i wanted pancakes. like BAM, pancakes. and the fight scenes, hah, reminded me of when you’re scrambling eggs and the yolk just... breaks? chaos. colors flying. probs the cinematographer’s a genius or just lucky.

my god, some guy coughing like he’s auditioning for a horror flick behind me. for reals. why do people who cough always sit behind you? it’s like rule universe made. was that in the movie or the theater? who knows at this point.

oh!!! remember that you can watch the movie later, someone told me the other day, like how do I even remember? it's this mix of deja vu and something half-forgotten from a dream. the theater smell— like, junk food heaven. I think that's what makes memory stick, I swear, that scent—bang.

and the final scene. oh boy, they really crammed all fireworks they had left into that. felt like a carnival exploded right in my face. wasn't sure if i was in tears or just burnt out from flashing lights.

random thought: was that soundtrack or tinnitus? man, i can’t tell. my ears’ ringing like a church bell in a cartoon when a character gets bonked on the head. but it was fun, in this weird fever dream way. 

gonna stick with my original plan: coffee now. thoughts need it, badly. ok, friend, that's it. i think you would dig it, even if just for chaos' sake.
